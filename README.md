# Spring Framework Course

This repository is for an example application built in my [Spring Framework 5 - Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/testing-spring-boot-beginner-to-guru/?couponCode=GITHUB_REPO) online course

The application is a simple Spring Boot 2 / Spring Framework 5 web application.

This repository was forked and represents a starting point in building the app throughout the course.
